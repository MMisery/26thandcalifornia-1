# Contributing to 26th and California

The 26th and California project welcomes non-coders and coders alike to contribute to building a useful and informative site about the Cook County Jail inmate population.

All contributors should request access to the [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ak3IIavLYTovdExmUldWMVVDR3I5MWtFU01Nc054Mmc&usp=drive_web) which powers the site's content.
