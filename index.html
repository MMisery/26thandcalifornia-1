  <p id="body1" class="crypt-text">If you're worried about whether the government can read your emails, I have good news and bad news. The bad news is that a determined, well-resourced attacker will almost always find a way. But the good news is that there are basic steps you can take to protect your privacy, and they most likely will make a difference. I asked some of the leading figures in the unclassified cryptography community about what they do, personally, to safeguard their most important communications.</p>

  <p id="body2" class="crypt-text">The most important thing they stressed was that the solution to government espionage against the citizenry is not technical, but political. Governments with nearly unlimited resources will always have some ability to spy on individual people if they so desire. It is therefore incumbent on us to think seriously about what level of government surveillance we are comfortable with, and to push back against efforts we consider overly intrusive.</p>

  <div class="pull-out">
    <p>
      <span id="schneier" class="crypt-text">I think the average person needs to understand that this is a political problem, that the surveillance state has gotten too powerful and needs to be reined in.  That this is not a matter of spying on the bad guys; it's a matter of spying on everyone, and making us all less safe.</span>

  <p id="body3" class="crypt-text">One way to regain some control over our own security is to personally encrypt our most sensitive data. This is more effective an approach than you might think: grounded in solid mathematical principles, open-source encryption tools available today make it effectively impossible for even the most sophisticated attacker to decrypt a message. This is because they rely on intrinsic properties of very large numbers that are fairly mind-blowing.</p>

  <p id="body4" class="crypt-text">For instance, as Bruce Schneier demonstrated in Applied Cryptography, if you were to hook up a decryption computer to a supernova and convert all of the energy released by that stellar explosion into attempts to decode a secret with brute force, you would eventually be able to guess any 219-bit password. Typical strong passwords today are 256 bits, meaning you would need one supernova to get to 219 bits; another one to get to 220 bits; another one to get to 221 bits; and eventually, 38 supernovae just to guess one password.</p>

      <span id="etsy" class="crypt-text">The biggest, and easiest first step is to use something like LastPass or 1Password. The NSA doesn't usually target the mathematics of encryption - most of that is really solid. A more common approach is to steal passwords or attack weaknesses in software (that's how they gained access to android and iPhone data).</span>
      <br><br>
      <span id="etsy2" class="crypt-text">Lots of people will say not to use the same password on multiple sites, but that's really hard. Using one of the above tools makes it super easy. They will generate, remember, and auto-fill long complex unique passwords on websites for you.</span>

      <span id="garret" class="crypt-text">I don't use encryption myself, mainly because it's such a colossal [pain]. I also think it's the Wrong Answer. I believe the only effective way to stop the descent into a surveillance state (and from there to a police state) is politically, not technologically. The balance of power is tilted so heavily in favor of the NSA at the moment that for a non-technical person to try to evade them is probably hopeless. The only effective way to stop ubiquitous surveillance is to take away the legal authority under which it is conducted.</span>

      <span id="weis" class="crypt-text">The recent revelations about NSA capabilities have not changed my assessment of best practices for communication security. So far, most of the allegations are about circumventing cryptosystems through people or processes, not breaking the underlying algorithms. That could change with more revelations, but as of now, nothing has been a big surprise. One exception is that NIST standards, particularly for elliptic curve cryptography, are under more scrutiny from the crypto community.</span>
